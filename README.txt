We have continuous output values (Weekly Sales) so we need to use a regression algorithm, rahter than a classifier algorithm.

Need to research hyperparameter optimization...

We have feature rich data on the historical training & testing set.  Some of these features cant be used for prediction of 
future data items, but it can be used to develop hyperparameters to tune the fit of the learning algorithm.
